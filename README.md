# SWAN
This is a containerized distribution of SWAN (Simulating WAves Nearshore) Version 41.01 by Louisiana State University Coastal Resilience Collaboratory (https://crc.cct.lsu.edu/).

SWAN is a third-generation wave model that computes random, short-crested wind-generated waves in coastal regions and inland waters. SWAN accounts for the following physics: Wave propagation in time and space, shoaling, refraction due to current and depth, frequency shifting due to currents and non-stationary depth, Wave generation by wind, Three- and four-wave interactions, Whitecapping, bottom friction and depth-induced breaking, Dissipation due to vegetation, Wave-induced set-up, Propagation from laboratory up to global scales, Transmission through and reflection (specular and diffuse) against obstacles, and Diffraction.
